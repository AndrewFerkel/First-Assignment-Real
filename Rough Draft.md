# Learning to Take Professional Pictures
***

## 1. Technical Information: Three main features influence the quality of the pictures being taken when the camera is in its manual setting, shutter speed, ISO, and aperature. For the sake of simplicity, I am going to explain how to make the technical adjustments on a Cannon camera since they are the type that your yearbook uses. 

**Shutter Speed** is an important part of taking pictures even for beginners. It does exactly what its name indicates; it increases or decreases the speed of the lense's shutter. The faster it opens and closes the less light makes it into the camera, and the slower it does so, the more light will enter. Whenever too little light enters, the picture comes out dark, and when too much light gets in, the photo begins to show the subtle shaking of the photographer's hands, making the image blurry. These are very common issues so you will want to make sure each member of your yearbooks staff know how to avoid them. Below I included an easy reference tool for the students as they go about taking pictures.

### A. Longer Exposure or Low Shutter Speed = Blurry Photos
### B. Shorter Exposure or High Shutter Speed = Freeze Motion
### C. Photographers most commonly have the shutter speed resting at 1/60 but anywhere from 1/500, during fast-paced events like sports, to 1/8, for pictures like mugshots, will work. 

The shutter speed can be adjusted with a scroll tool in front of the picture-taking button, where the user will be resting their forefinger. Scrolling it counterclockwise will increase the shutterspeed or lower the number on the screen, and scrolling it clockwise will decrease the shutterspeed or make raise the number.

**ISO** stands for International Standards Organization, the association that standardizes sensitivity technology for cameras. Likewise, the setting on the camera called ISO regulates how sensitive the device is to the light that enters the lense. By setting the ISO number lower, the lense becomes less sensitive, and the picture will be darker. In the same way, setting the ISO too high will result in a very bright photo. Ideally, each student should find the right setting for each situation. Below are a few common situations to help troubleshooting: 

### A. Sunny, No shade, Bright Scenes – 100 ISO
### B. Sunny, Little Shade, Bright Scenes – 200 ISO
### C. Overcast, Bright Indoor Scenes – 200-400 ISO
### D. Sunny, Near Sunset, Dimly Lit Scenes – 400-800 ISO
### E. Inside, By Window – 400 ISO and above 
### F. Inside, Not By Window – 600 ISO and above 
### G. Dark Indoor Scenes, Outdoor at Night – 1600 ISO

On a Cannon camera, the ISO changes with the same scroll function as the shutterspeed. Although, the students will need to hold down the ISO button next to the scroll bar while they rotate it. I included a picture of this below to add some clarity.

**Aperture** or F-stop is the final technical aspect of taking pictures that the yearbook students should know. A lens aperture is the opening that controls how much light passes through. A camera is equipped with a range of openings referred to as F-Stops. The larger the F-Stop, the smaller the opening, resulting in less light passing through. Below is a basic guide to aperture setting depending on how many people are in the picture and the distance between the photographer and the focus of the shot.

### A. 1 person = 1.2-2.8 {Blurry Background}
### B. 2 people = 2.8 or 3.5 {Blurry Background}
### C. 3 people = 3.5 or up {Less Blurry}
### D. 4 people = 4.5 or up {Less Blurry}
### E. 5 people = 5.5 or up {Clear Background}
### F. Depth of Field – What is in or out of focus
#### i. Shallow - Good for isolating subjects
#### ii. Deep – Good for Landscapes
